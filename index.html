				<h2>WHAT IS WEB DEVELOPMENT?</h2>
				<p>Web development is the process of developing websites and web applications that work on the internet.
					It includes web design, network security configuration, client-side/server-side scripting, and web
					content development among other tasks.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2 class="r-fit-text">What's The Process<br />Behind<br />Website Development?</h2>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>Before you start<br />Remember!</h2>
				<p>Attempting to build a website without a plan is like trying to construct a house without an
					architectural blueprint.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Let's discuss the Life cycle involved in Website Development</p>
			</section>
			<section data-background="dist/img/7-Phases-of-web-development-life-cycle.jpg" class="bg-img">
			</section>

			<section style="text-align: left;">
				<h2 class="title-highlight">Research & Analysis</h2>
				<p>The life cycle of web development starts with Research & Analysis. Establish the criteria and assist
					them in locating the ideal solution. Know your target market and how the website will be used to
					achieve your business's goals.</p>
				<p>If you don't already have one, we will be pleased to assist you in developing one.</p>
			</section>

			<section style="text-align: left;">
				<h2 class="title-highlight">Planning & Strategy</h2>
				<p>This phase involves allocating resources, defining deliverables, estimating timescales, and creating
					a sitemap.</p>
				<p>A complete list of all the website's areas and sub-topics is required. This is a guide that defines
					the site's content and provides an easy-to-use navigation mechanism.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section style="text-align: left;">
				<h2 class="title-highlight">Design</h2>
				<p>Choosing the website's appearance and feel is the next process. It is crucial to incorporate things
					like the company logo and colours that support the website's branding during the design phase.</p>
				<p>A designer's efforts result in the website layout. It might be a full graphic design or a sketch. The
					layout's primary aim is to describe information structure, display content, and illustrate basic
					functions. Colors, logos, and images are included in layouts, which may provide a general concept of
					the future product.</p>
			</section>

			<section style="text-align: left;">
				<h2 class="title-highlight">Content creation</h2>
				<p>Writing and compiling content frequently overlaps with other stages of website creation. This phase
					needs you to write out the substance of what you want to communicate to your website's audience and
					include calls to action. Content writing also includes developing eye-catching headlines, text
					editing, new text writing, and assembling existing text. Additionally, your material should be
					appealing, SEO-friendly, and simple to understand.</p>
			</section>

			<section style="text-align: left;">
				<h2 class="title-highlight">Development</h2>
				<p>The true website construction happens during the development stage. The website's client-side and
					server-side code are developed at this point. During the website creation process, it takes the
					longest.</p>
				<p>SEO is another essential component (Search Engine Optimization). In order to help your site get
					higher search engine rankings, SEO involves improving website elements like the title, description,
					and keyword.</p>
			</section>

			<section style="text-align: left;">
				<h2 class="title-highlight">Testing & quality assurance</h2>
				<p>One of the most crucial elements of any process is testing. After being created, the website is
					tested. Every single link should be checked to make sure there are no broken ones.Â </p>
				<p>The quality assurance team tests the website's performance, compatibility, and functionality across
					all devices to ensure that it is prepared for launch. Additional testing may include stress testing,
					scalability testing, load testing, resolution testing, and cross-browser testing.</p>
			</section>

			<section style="text-align: left;">
				<h2 class="title-highlight">Maintenance</h2>
				<p>After deployment, the web development phases continue. After a deployment, a lot of things need to be
					finished. As a result of user input, maintenance, and support, several sections have been updated.
					To maintain the site functioning properly and attracting new visitors, frequent upkeep and changes
					are necessary.</p>
				<p>It is crucial to keep your website up to date.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<p>Always keep in mind that the website development project does not begin with coding and does not
					conclude once your website is live. Understanding the client's requirements, knowledge about the
					target audience, market research, planning, design, development, testing, and maintenance are all
					part of the journey.</p>
